# Path to Roll

A Chrome extension that enhances the interaction between Pathbuilder 2e character sheets and Roll20. It automatically copies skill checks to your clipboard and can directly paste them into Roll20's chat.

## Features

### Roll Management
- **One-Click Rolling**: Click any skill, attack, or spell on your Pathbuilder sheet to generate a formatted roll string
- **Roll20 Template Format**: Rolls are formatted using Roll20's template system, including:
  - Character name
  - Skill/Attack/Spell name
  - Roll formula with modifier
  - Additional context (proficiency level, traits, damage types, etc.)
- **Automatic Roll20 Integration**: When a single Roll20 game tab is open and ready, rolls will be automatically pasted into the chat
- **Enhanced Critical Hit Formatting**: Critical hit information is now displayed in a more readable format:
  - Shows critical multiplier (e.g., "2x")
  - Displays additional critical damage with clickable roll links
  - Format: "2x + [additional damage] ([Roll Additional Critical])"

### Status Indicators
- **Pathbuilder Status**: Shows whether a Pathbuilder character sheet is open
  - Green: Page is open and ready
  - Red: No page open
- **Roll20 Status**: Shows the connection state with Roll20
  - Green: One game tab open and fully connected
  - Orange: Multiple game tabs open
  - Red with "Not ready": Page is open but not ready (needs refresh)
  - Red with "No page open": No Roll20 game detected

### Customization

  - When enabled: Blocks Pathbuilder's dice tray for a cleaner experience
  - When disabled: Allows both Roll20 integration and Pathbuilder's native rolling
